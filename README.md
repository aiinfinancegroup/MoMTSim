# MoMTSim Project

MoMTSim is a multi-agent simulation platform tailored to mobile money financial transactions from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) for generating synthetic financial transactions in the domain.
Unlike related studies, we collected qualitative data from stakeholders such as Telco IT officers, Banks, Agents, Clients and Merchants to aid modelling. 
We also obtained a sample real mobile money transactions data from one of our stakeholders in the region in order to extract statistical information for the simulations.

## Design Considerations for the Simulation Platform
Our paper: **Scenario-based Synthetic Dataset Generation for Mobile Money Transactions** details the design considerations for the simulation platform and unique fraud scenarios in the Sub-saharan Context. Access here:
